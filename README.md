Mendelevium
===========

Mendelevium is a PHP Log Center that relies on Redis as backend.

There are two main motivations for the creation of Mendelevium :

1 - I wanted to build something using Redis.

2 - Logging on relation style (SQL) database is slow, .txt is slow, bla bla bla Redis is faster and its cooler.

Usage
=====

Take the whole folder Mendelevium and add it to your project, find out for $projName and change it to something that suits your project.

So, just do above your project $Mendelevium->log("message here") and be happy.
