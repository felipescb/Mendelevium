Mendelevium
===========

Mendelevium is a PHP Log Center that relies on Redis as backend.

There are two main motivations for the creation of Mendelevium :

1 - I wanted to build something using Redis.

2 - Logging on relation style (SQL) database is slow, .txt is slow, bla bla bla Redis is faster and its cooler.
